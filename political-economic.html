        <p>International organizations and NGOs have implemented programs to empower women economically in Palestine. This includes entrepreneurship training and resources, supporting women-owned businesses, and promoting access to finance and microcredit.

        <h4>New York</h4>
        <img src="resources/img14.avif" alt="alt" width="600" height="250"/>
        <p>The government can promote political measures to increase representation of women in leadership positions by implementing policies that encourage diversity and inclusivity in the workplace, including affirmative action programs. Such measures can help address systemic barriers that prevent women from advancing in their careers and create a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
